**Offer Service**

**Background**

Per Wikipedia, "an offer is a proposal to sell a specific product or
service under specific conditions". As a merchant I offer goods for
sale. I want to create an offer so that I can share it with my
customers.

All my offers have shopper friendly descriptions. I price all my offers
up front in a defined currency.

An offer is time-bounded, with the length of time an offer is valid for
defined as part of the offer, and should expire automatically. Offers may
also be explicitly cancelled before they expire.


**Assignment**

You are required to create a simple RESTful software service that will
allow a merchant to create a new simple offer. Offers, once created, may be
queried. After the period of time defined on the offer it should expire and
further requests to query the offer should reflect that somehow. Before an offer
has expired users may cancel it.
